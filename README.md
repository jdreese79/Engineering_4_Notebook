This is where all of my stuff will go!

## Hello Python
### Lessons Learned
##### For this assignment, we had to make a random dice roller . We learned how to use a while loop and how to code for user input. At first, we didn't know how to make the program stop giving us random numbers. In order to fix this, we had an "if true" statement that would stop the program when it was found false.

## Python Program 01- Calculator
### Lessons Learned
##### Our objective for this assignment was to code a program that uses a function to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the modulo of two numbers inputed by the user. We had trouble figuring out what to put in the doMath function at first and also how make the function round our answers. We figured these problems out through google and the people around us.

## Python Program 02- Quadratic Solver
### Lessons Learned
##### This assignment was a lot like the Python Calculator, except that for this one we had to create two original functions in order to find the real roots of a quadratic function. We made a 'solveQuad" function to find discrimant whuch determines the amount of real roots, and a "findRoots" function to find the actual roots. Once we figured out how to use the functions that we made in the rest of our code, it was pretty simple to code the rest. We used an if/elif/else to either find 0, 1, or 2 roots, and an array to print them.

## Hello Git
### Lessons Learned
#### This assignment was meant to help us familiarize ourselves with github and make an account. It was very straightforaward because the code for everything was listed on Canvas. We got stuck when trying to commit the file but we got help and it worked.

## Forks and Clones
### Lessons Learned
##### During this assignment, we learned how to edit someone elses repository using forks and clones. First we went to the page we wanted to edit (in this case it was a chart that listed our names and a fact about ourselves) and forked it on github.com. We then went to terminal and cloned it onto our pi. We opened the file, made our edits, then commited and pushed it back to github.

## Strings and Loops
### Lessons Learned
##### For this assignment, we had to code a program that takes a simple sentence and splits it into an array of words. At first, we couldn't figure out how to put a loop inside of a loop, but then we got help and it started working.

## Hangman
### Lessons Learned
##### For this assignment, we had to code a hangman game. Our biggest problem was figuring out how to make the program save letters that were already guessed and we solved this by using and "enumerate" function. At the very end, we also couldn't figure out how to make the program stop once the full word was guessed. The solution was simple though and all we had to had was a "sys.exit()."
