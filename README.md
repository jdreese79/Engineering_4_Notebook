## Hello Python
### Lessons Learned
##### For this assignment, we had to make a random dice roller . We learned how to use a while loop and how to code for user input. At first, we didn't know how to make the program stop giving us random numbers. In order to fix this, we had an "if true" statement that would stop the program when it was found false.

## Python Program 01- Calculator
### Lessons Learned
##### Our objective for this assignment was to code a program that uses a function to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the modulo of two numbers inputed by the user. We had trouble figuring out what to put in the doMath function at first and also how make the function round our answers. We figured these problems out through google.
